# TeenHive - A Facebook-Inspired Social Hub for MIT Students

**TeenHive** is a private social media platform designed specifically for students of MIT. Modeled after Facebook, this platform brings together the core features of a modern social network — profiles, posting, messaging, and a friend system — with a unique twist: a built-in two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game to break the ice.
